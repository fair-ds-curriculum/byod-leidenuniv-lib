Teaching material from Bring Your Own Data FAIRification workshops at Leiden University Library. This pilot workshop is organised by the Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) for PhD students to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), with focus on the Interoperable and the Reusable aspects. We will first introduce the concept of FAIR data. Secondly, we will create a data model and go through a tutorial with an example data set together, followed by a hands-on session on how to make the particular datasets from the participants FAIR, and finally end with a discussion about how to share and publish FAIR data.

This pilot workshop targets Data Science PhD student with the aim to roll out to different disciplines within the coming year.
